# 🎭 Face-Swap AI with Streamlit

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **AI-powered Face-Swap application** built using **InsightFace**, **OpenCV**, and **Streamlit**.  
The app allows users to **upload images or capture from a camera**, detect faces, and swap them seamlessly.  
It highlights the **practical use of AI in computer vision**, while also addressing the **ethical implications** of deepfake technology.

## 🚀 Features
- 📷 Upload images or capture directly from camera  
- 🤖 Face detection & alignment using **InsightFace**  
- 🔄 Seamless face-swapping with **OpenCV** blending  
- 🌐 Deployable as a **Streamlit web app**  
- ⚡ Interactive, lightweight, and beginner-friendly

## 🛠️ Libraries & Why They’re Used
- **[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/):** Real-time image processing and blending  
- **[InsightFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface):** Advanced face detection, recognition & alignment  
- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/):** Easy-to-use framework for interactive app deployment  
- **NumPy:** Array operations for image manipulation  
- **Pillow (PIL):** Image format handling and saving

Download the swapped image for use

🌍 Applications

✅ Entertainment (Snapchat, TikTok filters, VFX in movies)
✅ Education & AR/VR avatars
✅ Healthcare (face reconstruction previews)
✅ Gaming & digital avatars

⚠️ Ethical Considerations

While face-swapping has positive applications, it can also be misused in:
❌ Fake celebrity videos
❌ Political misinformation
❌ Identity theft & scams

This project is strictly educational and built to encourage responsible AI usage.

📈 Future Scope

Real-time video face-swapping

GAN-based realistic outputs

Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)

AI-powered deepfake detectors for ethics & safety
